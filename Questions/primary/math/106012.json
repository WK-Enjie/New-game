Let me check calculation:\nIf total = 42: Boys = 18, Girls = 24, Difference = 6 (not 12)\nIf total = 49: Boys = 21, Girls = 28, Difference = 7\nIf total = 56: Boys = 24, Girls = 32, Difference = 8\nIf total = 63: Boys = 27, Girls = 36, Difference = 9\nSo 1/7 = difference. If difference = 12, then total = 12 × 7 = 84\n84 is not an option, so the question should say '6 more girls' for 42 total.",
