            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "points": 5,
            "explanation": "Copper is less reactive than aluminum, so it requires less energy to extract from its ore."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "points": 5,
            "explanation": "Sodium is highly reactive and reacts vigorously with oxygen and water in air, so it is stored under oil to prevent these reactions."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
